# Inventory_Tracking_System_Api
The purpose of this project is to facilitate inventory tracking, prevent excess inventory,
identify needs, and streamline material and asset management in factories, production areas
and areas where inventories are used collectively.

Firstly, this web project is designed to facilitate material and asset management, enabling managers
to effectively track inventory.The system generates unique QR codes for each asset or material in the
inventory, allowing for the identification of each item. QR codes can be scanned through the website,
enabling users to quickly and easily associate items with their respective information.

The project includes a database where detailed information about assets and materials is
stored, ensuring that this information is kept up-to-date and facilitating tracking of
inventory movements. The system tracks the dates and other relevant details of each asset
or material, ensuring the accuracy and currency of the inventory. Additionally, it monitors material
usage, including purchases and current usage, providing managers with information about the inventory.

The reporting feature provides detailed reports on inventory movements, allowing users to monitor changes
and take measures to increase efficiency. QR code-integrated inventory tracking system provides businesses
the opportunity to optimize inventory management and effectively utilize resources, resulting in time and cost savings.
This web system was implemented by using .NET and Vue.js, with PostgreSQL database.
